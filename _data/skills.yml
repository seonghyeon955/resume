  description: I have experiences of leading project members successfully while I attending an academy as team leader.
               When we started our project, academy was closed because of Corona. When members tired of video conference by Google Meets, 
               I found an efficiency apartment-type studyroom. 
               We could stay there safely during the project and focus more on the project.
               Also I made project plans fastly, and made css overall which everyone could use in common. So our team could save the time and focus on coding more successfuly.
               Finally, there was a case where one member of our group left while on the project. It was really hard to bring up again from mixed mood of betrayal and panic, but i did.
               I created an enthusiastic mood and boosted morale, and could complete the project successfully.
